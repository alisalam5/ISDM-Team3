# The Problem Definition
*Research shows that the current system of operations inadequately matches end-customers to well-informed RMs, leading to unsatisfied customers and a decrease in sales.* 

## Objectives:
1. To develop a new efficient and improved information system for the travel company's in-house *call management centre* (CMC).
2. To improve call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls.
3. To implement a supporting tool that will successfully match end-customers to Relationship Managers (RMs).
4. To minimise costs while increasing the efficiency of RMs and inbound calls. 
5. To create an effective system that can continue to operate capably during rush-hour and high intensity periods. 

## Assumptions:
1. It is assumed that the current information system supporting the operation of in-house CMC is insufficient in serving customers effectively and efficiently.
2. It is assumed that call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls in the current systems of operations is insufficient in serving customers effectively and efficiently.
3. It is assumed that RMs have not been allocated to their appropriate customer and knowledge base, creating inefficiencies and failure of sales in the current system of operations.
4. It is assumed that the current operations do not provide RMs with a proper means of targeting and securing new potential customers.
5. It is assumed that a supporting tool for RMs to create customer profiles exists in the system of operations, under the name “Profiler Tool.”
6. It is assumed that during high intensity periods the system of operations is not proficient enough to provide high quality service towards its customers.
7. It is assumed that the system will log all call outcomes.
