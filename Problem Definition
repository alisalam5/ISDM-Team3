**The Problem Definition**

# Objectives:

* To develop a new efficient and improved information system for the travel company's in-house *call management centre* (CMC).
* To improve call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls.
* To implement a supporting tool that will successfully match end-customers to Relationship Managers (RMs).
* To minimise costs while increasing the efficiency of RMs and inbound calls. 
* To create an effective system that can continue to operate capably during rush-hour and high intensity periods. 

#Assumptions:

*	It is assumed that RMs have not been allocated to their appropriate customer and knowledge base, creating inefficiencies and 
failure of sales in the current system of operations. 
*	It is assumed that the current operations do not provide RMs with a proper means of targeting and securing new potential customers. 
*	It is assumed that during high intensity periods the system of operations is not proficient enough to provide high quality service 
towards its customers.
